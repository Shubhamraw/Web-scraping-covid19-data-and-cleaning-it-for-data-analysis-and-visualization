Data analysis on worldwide covid19 data (june-2020):  
1. Data preparation: Dataset prepared by three method, 
   Method 1 & 2: Web scraping wordometer site using beautifulsoup  and another using pandas dataframe directly (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?) 
   Method 3: Reading out COVID19 data repository prepared by Johns Hopkins University in pandas dataframe. e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
   
   Automation code to keep dataset up to date 
   
   and transforming raw data into an understandable format to dive in it in later stage.



2. Exploratory Data analysis (the file is about 50mb to i compressed it to save it into my repository): 
   to look into data e.g. confirmed, deaths & recovered cases    
   Top15 affected countries ?, Average cases/day, comparison with other  
   diseases and visualizing using plotly, matplotlib and seaborn libraries
